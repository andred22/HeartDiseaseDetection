# Advancing Heart Disease Detection With KNN Machine Learning Classifier

## Project Overview
-----

This project began as an academic exercise but has since been enhanced to showcase my data science skills as part of my professional portfolio. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimizing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, I achieved an accuracy of 91% in predicting heart disease.

**Data Acquisition**: Downloaded the dataset and imported necessary libraries.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted descriptive statistics and created visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

**Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Classifier Development**: Built and trained an initial classification model to predict heart disease.

**Post Hoc Feature Selection with PCA**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, selecting key features to improve model performance.

**Model Refinement**: Enhanced the classifier using the selected features to achieve higher accuracy.

**Model Evaluation**: Reviewed the model's performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Included in this repository are the following:



**Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the full analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
**Heart.csv**: The original dataset used for this analysis.
