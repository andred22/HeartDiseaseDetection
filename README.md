# Advancing Heart Disease Detection With KNN Machine Learning Classifier

## Project Overview
-----

This project initially began as an academic exercise but has since been enhanced to showcase my data science skills as part of my professional portfolio. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimizing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, I achieved an accuracy of 91% in predicting heart disease.

Included in this repository are the following:

**Jupyter Notebook**: Contains the full analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
**Graphs**: A collection of visualizations demonstrating my ability to communicate data insights effectively.
**Heart.csv**: The original dataset used for this analysis.
