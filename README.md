# Advancing Heart Disease Detection With KNN Machine Learning Classifier

## Project Overview

This project focused on leveraging K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification to predict heart disease. Originally developed for an academic course, it has been refined to highlight my growth in data science and machine learning. Through data preprocessing and the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the model achieved an accuracy of 91%. This work illustrates my proficiency in developing and evaluating predictive models.

## Project Contents

**Environment Set-Up and Data Acquisition**: Downloaded the dataset and imported necessary libraries.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted descriptive statistics and created visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

**Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Classifier Development**: Built and trained an initial classification model to predict heart disease.

**Post Hoc Feature Selection with PCA**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, selecting key features to improve model performance.

**Model Refinement**: Enhanced the classifier using the selected features and optimized hyperparameters to achieve higher accuracy.

**Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score and analyzing potential factors that could have impacted the results.
