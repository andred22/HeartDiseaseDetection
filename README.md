# Advancing Heart Disease Detection With KNN Machine Learning Classifier

## Project Overview
-----

This project began as an academic exercise but has since been enhanced to showcase my data science skills as part of my professional portfolio. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and optimizing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, I achieved an accuracy of 91% in predicting heart disease.

**Environment Set-Up and Data Acquisition**: Downloaded the dataset and imported necessary libraries.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted descriptive statistics and created visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.

**Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed the data to handle any missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**Classifier Development**: Built and trained an initial classification model to predict heart disease.

**Post Hoc Feature Selection with PCA**: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, selecting key features to improve model performance.

**Model Refinement**: Enhanced the classifier using the selected features to achieve higher accuracy.

**Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score and analyzing potential factors that could have impacted the results.
