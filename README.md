# Advancing Heart Disease Detection With KNN Machine Learning Classifier

Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting the presence of heart disease using a dataset of patient health metrics. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to develop a model that can accurately classify individuals as having heart disease or not, based on their health data.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. The primary notebook, heart_disease_analysis.ipynb, walks through the entire process from data loading to model evaluation.

data/: Stores the dataset used in this project. If the dataset is too large to be included, instructions for downloading it are provided in the README.md.

scripts/: Includes Python scripts that contain reusable functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and other tasks. This modular approach keeps the notebook clean and allows for easy reuse of code.

results/: Holds the outputs of the analysis, such as visualizations, performance metrics, and model files.

docs/: (Optional) Contains additional documentation or in-depth explanations of certain aspects of the project.

README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set up the environment, and how to run the code.

requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required to run the project, making it easy for others to install the necessary dependencies.

LICENSE: Specifies the terms under which the project can be used by others.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available heart disease dataset that includes various health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. Each record represents a patient, and the target variable indicates whether or not the patient has heart disease.

Methods
The project involves several key steps:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions to prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to uncover patterns, relationships, and distributions among the features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Experimenting with different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors) and selecting the best-performing one based on accuracy and other metrics.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the selected model using cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC scores, and other performance metrics.
Model Deployment: Saving the trained model for potential future use.
Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy], with a ROC-AUC score of [insert score]. The model was able to effectively distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in the medical field.

Conclusion
This project highlights the application of machine learning to healthcare data, showing that with proper data preparation and model selection, it is possible to build a predictive model that can assist in diagnosing heart disease. Future work could involve tuning the models further, exploring more advanced algorithms, and expanding the dataset for greater accuracy.
